# Corsair-K95-Keycaps

This is essentially a fork of <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii/openSCAD-projects/tree/master/key">this</a> file by <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii">rsheldiii</a>. I am designing this to be a full layout of Corsair's K95 keyboard.

## Note:
This is a work in progress
