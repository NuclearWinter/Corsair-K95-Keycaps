# Corsair-K95-Keycaps

This is essentially a fork of <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii/openSCAD-projects/tree/master/key">this</a> file by <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii">rsheldiii</a>. I am designing this to be a full layout of Corsair's K95 keyboard.

## Note:
I'm not going to work on this anymore becuase the render takes to long and the value of a full preview isn't worth the effort imo. If you're doing this kind of project I reccomend that you just do keys one by one, but I'm leaving this repo up in case anyone needs this.
